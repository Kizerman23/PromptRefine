## 🚀 Step 1: Installation (Developer Mode)

Since this is a custom premium tool, you'll need to load it manually into your browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, or any Chromium-based browser):

1.  **Download & Extract**: Download the project folder to your computer.
2.  **Open Extensions**: 
    - In **Chrome**: go to `chrome://extensions/`
    - In **Brave**: go to `brave://extensions/`
    - In **Edge**: go to `edge://extensions/`
3.  **Enable Developer Mode**: Flip the switch (usually in the top right or left) to "ON".
4.  **Load the Extension**: Click the **"Load unpacked"** button in the top left.
5.  **Select Folder**: Choose the `PromptRefine` folder you just downloaded.
6.  **Login Required**: Navigate to [PromptCowboy.ai/login](https://www.promptcowboy.ai/login) and log in to your account. **The extension will not work without an active login.**

**Done!** You should see the PromptCowboy icon in your extensions list and it's ready to enhance!

## 💡 Step 2: How to Use

Once installed, navigate to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai), or [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com). You'll see a sleek control panel appear at the **bottom right** of the screen.

### The 3 Power Modes:

*   **⚡ Auto**: Type your prompt, hit Enter, and watch the magic happen. The extension will enhance your prompt and **send it automatically** once finished. Perfect for maximum speed!
*   **📝 Manual (Recommended)**: The extension enhances your prompt but **waits for you** to review it. You can then hit Enter again to send, or click "Undo" to get your original text back.
*   **😴 Off**: Disables the extension completely on the current page. Use this if you want to send a prompt without any cow tipping.

## 🎯 Site-Specific Control

One of the best features is the ability to **selectively disable** the extension. 

> [!TIP]
> If you are working in a specific AI model (like Gemini) and don't want the enhancer to trigger there, simply click the **"Off"** button in the floating panel. This allows you to keep the extension active on ChatGPT while it stays quiet on other sites.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Auth Required" Alert
The extension uses the **PromptCowboy.ai** engine. If you see an alert saying you are logged out:
1.  Go to [PromptCowboy.ai/login](https://www.promptcowboy.ai/login).
2.  Log in to your account.
3.  Refresh your AI page (ChatGPT/Gemini).

### Red "Stop & Revert" Button
If the enhancement is taking too long or you changed your mind mid-typing, just click the red **"Stop & Revert"** button. It will immediately kill the process and restore your original prompt.
